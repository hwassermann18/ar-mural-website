# AR Mural MKDocs Website
This is a repository of some documentation for AR Mural at WINLAB. We had to create another repository in order to easily deploy a website, which wasn't possible on WINLAB's Gitlab. 

To locally view and edit the website:
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project directory in terminal
3. Write `mkdocs serve`
4. An output link will appear, hold down **CTRL** and click the link and the local website will appear so you can easily view your changes as you make them.
5. Create or modify any .md files

We deploy our website with Cloudflare pages. If future groups want to continue adding documentation I recommend forking this repo and deploying it on Cloudflare pages as well, since requirements.txt file is already configured to work with the system.

Here is a good video to get started on hosting an MKDocs website on Cloudflare: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-HhLascLuM&t=890s
