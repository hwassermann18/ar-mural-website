
Another goal of the 2026 AR Mural team was to improve documentation. AR Mural is one of the longest running WINLAB summer projects, so creating accurate and concise documentation would make the onboarding process much easier. Trying to learn how all the files work themselves and together can be overwhelming at first, especially if you have limited unity experience. We will introduce you to the different file types in the project and how they fit together to create AR Mural. 
## General Project Folder Structure
In the ar-mural-summer-2025 project folder you'll see many different folders. Lets break them down:

1. **Assets**: Core folder where all your project files live. This includes:
    - **Scenes**: Contains .unity scene files, which define different environments. For our case we will really only use our 'main' scene.
    - **Scripts**: Houses C# scrips that control behavior. This is all of the logic behind our drawing tools.
        - Inside this folder we have 
        - Notice also that for every C# script there is a corresponding meta file. Unity creates .meta files for every asset in the Assets folder. These files track assets using unique GUIDS, ensuring references remain intact even if files are moved or renamed. Losing them can cause missing assets and project inconsistencies.

    - **Prefabs**: Stores reusable game objects.
    - **Materials & Textures**: Defines visual properties and textures for objects.
    - **Local Objects**: Uploaded objects that users can import into the scene
    - **MTQQnet**: Folder that holds the MQTTnet library files necessary for managing a server. We will go into more detail about MQTT and how we create a server later.
    
2. **Packages**: Manages dependencies and Unity packages used in the project
3. **Library**: A cache folder unity generates for faster loading (should not be edited)
4. **ProjectSettings**: Stores configuration files for things like input settings and rendering.
5. **Temp**: A temporary folder used during compilation (regenerated by Unity automatically).
